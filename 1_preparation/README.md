# data-integration Project

## Building

### Running in dev mode
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args="lobby-data-2022-05-08.json corporate-events-dump.json"
```

Opening the Neo4J webui. If not specified otherwise in the console output open your browser
on [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474). The default login credentials are `neo4j/password`.

### Building
```shell script
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

Running with testdata:

```shell script
java -jar target/data-integration-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar lobby-data-2022-05-08.json corporate-events-dump.json
```

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/data-integration-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

### Picocli Example

Hello and goodbye are civilization fundamentals. Let's not forget it with this example picocli application by changing
the <code>command</code> and <code>parameters</code>.

[Related guide section...](https://quarkus.io/guides/picocli#command-line-application-with-multiple-commands)

Also for picocli applications the dev mode is supported. When running dev mode, the picocli application is executed and
on press of the Enter key, is restarted.

As picocli applications will often require arguments to be passed on the commandline, this is also possible in dev mode
via:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args='Quarky'
```
